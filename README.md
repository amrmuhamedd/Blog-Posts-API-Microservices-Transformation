# Blog Posts API - Microservices Transformation  

This repository is dedicated to the transformation of the Blog Posts API from a monolithic architecture to a microservices-based architecture. The goal is to create a more scalable, maintainable, and modular system, aligning with modern software development practices.  

## Goals  

1. **Service Separation**  
   Decompose the monolithic application into independent services, each responsible for a specific domain:  
   - **Auth Service**: Handles user authentication and role-based access.  
   - **Post Service**: Manages blog posts, including CRUD, scheduling, tags, and categories.  
   - **Comment Service**: Provides functionality for nested comments, moderation, and CRUD operations.  
   - **Reaction Service**: Enables like/unlike functionality for posts and comments.  
   - **Media Service**: Manages media uploads and optimization via Cloudinary.  
   - **Audit Service**: Tracks user actions and provides audit logs for compliance.  

2. **Scalability**  
   Enable horizontal scaling by allowing independent deployment of each service based on demand.  

3. **Service Communication**  
   Use RESTful APIs and RabbitMQ for asynchronous inter-service communication.  

4. **Data Management**  
   Follow the **Database-per-Service** pattern to ensure data isolation, scalability, and maintainability.  

5. **API Gateway**  
   Implement an API Gateway to centralize client requests, manage authentication, and handle service routing.  

6. **Resilience and Fault Tolerance**  
   Build services with mechanisms for fault tolerance, such as retries, circuit breakers, and monitoring.  

7. **Deployment**  
   Utilize Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration, enabling efficient deployments and scaling.  

8. **Testing and CI/CD**  
   Establish automated testing pipelines and CI/CD workflows to ensure reliability and speed in deployments.  

## Microservices Plan  

Each microservice will follow a consistent structure:  
```
src/ ├── controller.ts # Request handling and response formatting
├── service.ts # Business logic implementation
├── routes.ts # API route definitions and middleware
├── dto/ # Data Transfer Objects for validation
└── models/ # Database models
```

## Next Steps  

1. **Analyze Existing Code**  
   Review the [original monolithic repository](https://github.com/amrmuhamedd/blog-posts) to identify service boundaries.  

2. **Define API Contracts**  
   Specify API endpoints and request/response formats for each microservice.  

3. **Set Up Infrastructure**  
   Prepare shared infrastructure, including RabbitMQ, databases, and the API Gateway.  

4. **Incremental Development**  
   Start with one service (e.g., Auth) and incrementally develop and migrate features to microservices.
